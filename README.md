**Module 1: Introduction to AI Challenge**
**Overview and Origin**
Name of Company - Nvidia Corporation
When was the company incorporated?  Founded on April 5, 1993 in Santa Clara, CA and incorported in Delaware
Who are the founders of the company?  Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem
How did the idea of the company come about? > "In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing.  This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.  They also observed that video games were simultaeneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume."
How is the company funded?  How much funding have they received? > "With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.  The company susequently received $20M venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others.  Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999."
**Business Activities**
What specific problem is the company trying to solve?  > "Nvidia engineers the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future."
Who is the company's intended customer? Nvidia incorporates a platform strategy to grow in the Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive markets.  A potenial customer, for example, is Amazon through their  > "Omniverse platform for industrial digilization, which enables industries grounded in physical processes to become software-defined and connect large, highly skilled teams."
What solutions does this company offer that their competitors don't?  Nvidia has pioneerd accelerated computing and digital twins.
Which technologies are they currently using? >"Reinvenitng Modern Graphics - NVIDIA RTX taps into AI and ray tracing to deliver a whole new level of realism in graphics.  This year, they introduced the next breakthrough in AI powered graphics: DLSS 3."
**Landscape**
What field is the company in? > "It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces, (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market.  Nvidia is also a dominant suppier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.  Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research and manufacturing design."
What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 or 10 years? > "In May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by oberserving the person doing the jobs."
What are the other major companies in this field? Broadcom, Taiwan Seimiconductor Manufacturing, Alphabest, Apple, Microsfot and Meta Platforms.
How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? > "Limited success outside its core business:  Despite the high quality of its procducts, NVIDIA's efforts to expand into new markets have yielded limited access so far.  The company faces intense competition in the semiconductor market from AMD and Intel. Further, NVIDIA faces increasing pressure form consumer demands for improved user experiences at lower costs.  To remain commpetiive in the future, NVIDIA will need to find ways to maximize return on investment and produce cost-effective products for different market segments."
**Recommendations**
If you were to advise the company, what prodcuts or services would you suggest they offer? > "Opportunities - Growing AI and Cloud Computing Markets - The cloud computing and AI markets are expected to experience robust growth in the next five years, driven largely by digital transforamtion initiatives.  The increasing penetration of these technologies in a diverse range of applicaitons will provide several growth opporutnities with NVIDIA. The company can leverage its expertise in developing GPUs for AI and ML, attracing new customers such as Alibaba and Amazon."
