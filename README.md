Module 1: Introduction to AI Challenge 
Overview and Origin:
Name of Company - Nvidia Corporation
When was the company incorporated?  Founded on April 5, 1993 in Santa Clara, CA
Who are the founders of the company?  Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem
How did the idea of the company come about?  <!-- In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing.  This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods.  They also observed that video games were simultaeneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume.   -->
How is the company?  How much funding have they received?  <!-- With $40,000 in the bank, teh company was born.  The company susequently received $20M venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and others.  Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999. -->

What specific problem is the company trying to solve?  <!-- Nvidia engineers the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future -->
Who is the company's intended customer? Nvidia incorporates a platform strategy to grow in the Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive markets.  A potenial customer for example, is Amazon through their <!-- Omniverse platform for industrial digilization, which enables industries grounded in physical processes to become software-defined and connect large, highly skilled teams -->
What solutions does this company offer that their competitors do?  Nvidia has pioneerd accelerated computing and digital twins.
Which technologies are they currently using?  <!-- Reinvenitng Modern Graphisic - NVIDIA RTX taps into AI and ray tracing to deliver a whole new level of realism in graphics.  This year, they introduced the next breakthrough in AI powered graphics: DLSS 3. -->
What field is the company in?  <!-- It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces, (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market.  Nvidia is also a dominant suppier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.  Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research and manufacturing design.  -->
What have been teh major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 or 10 years?  <!-- In May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by oberserving the person doing the jobs -->
What are the other major companies in this field? Broadcom, Taiwan Seimiconductor Manufacturing, Alphabest, Apple, Microsfot and Meta Platforms
